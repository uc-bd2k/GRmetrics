\usage{
GRfit(inputData, groupingVariables, case = "A", force = FALSE, cap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputData}{a data table in one of the specified formats (Case A or
Case C). See details below for description. See \code{data(inputCaseA)} or
\code{data(inputCaseC)} for example input data frames. See help files for
\code{\link{inputCaseA}} and \code{\link{inputCaseC}} for description of
these examples.}

\item{groupingVariables}{a vector of column names from inputData. All of the
columns in inputData except for those identified here will be averaged over.}

\item{case}{either "A" or "C", indicating the format of the input data. See
below for descriptions of these formats.}

\item{force}{a logical value indicating whether to attempt to "force" a
sigmoidal fit, i.e. whether to allow fits with F-test p-values greater
than .05}

\item{cap}{a logical value indicating whether to cap GR values (or 
relative cell counts) at 1. If true, all values greater than 1 will 
be set to 1.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object containing GR metrics 
(GR50, GRmax, etc.) and traditional metrics (IC50, Emax, etc.) 
as well as goodness of fit measures is returned. The
object also contains, in its metadata, a table of the original data
converted to the style of "Case A" (with calculated GR values and relative 
cell counts for each row) and a vector of the grouping variables used for 
the calculation.

\description{
This function takes in a dataset with information about concentration,
cell counts over time, and additional grouping variables for a dose-response
assay and calculates growth-rate inhibition (GR) metrics as well as 
traditional metrics (IC50, Emax, etc.) for each experiment
in the dataset. The data must be in a specific format: either that specified
by case "A" or case "C" described in the details below.
}
\details{
Calculation of GR values is performed by the function \code{.GRcalculate}
according to the "Online Methods" section of Hafner and Niepel et al.
(2016, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3853}).

The fitting of the logistic curve is performed by the \code{.GRlogisticFit}
function, which calls the \code{drm} function from the \code{drc} package
to solve for the curve parameters. The GR curve fit function is
given by f(c) = GRinf + (1 - GRinf)/(1 + (c/GEC50)^h_GR) where c is
concentration. The fit is performed under following constraints: h_GR 
in [.1, 5], GRinf in [-1, 1], and GEC50 in [min(c)*1e-2, max(c)*1e2] (c is
concentration). The initial conditions for the fitting algorithm are h_GR 
= 2, GRinf = 0.1 and GEC50 = median(c). The fitting of the 
traditional dose response curve is done using the same formula, 
replacing GRinf with Einf, GEC50 with EC50, and h_GR with h. The fit is 
performed on the relative cell counts instead of GR values. Also, since the 
traditional dose response curve is bounded between 0 and 1 whereas the 
GR dose response curve is bounded between -1 and 1, we restrict Einf to 
the range [0, 1].

The parameters of the GR dose response curves (and traditional dose 
response curves) for each experiment are fitted separately. An
F-test is used to compare the sigmoidal fit to a flat line fit. If the
p-value of the F-test is less than .05, the sigmoidal fit is accepted. If
the p-value is greater than or equal to .05, a flat horizontal line fit is
given, with y equal to the mean of the GR values (or relative cell counts 
in the case of the traditional dose response curve). For each flat fit, 
GEC50 (or EC50) is set to 0, h_GR (or h) is set to 0.01, GRinf (or Einf) is
set to the y value of the flat fit, and GR50 (or IC50) is set to +/-Inf 
depending on whether GRinf (or Einf) is greater or less than .5. 

The mandatory columns for inputData for Case "A" are the following as
well as other grouping columns.

1. concentration - column with concentration values (not log transformed)
of the perturbagen on which dose-response curves will be evaluated

2. cell_count - column with the measure of cell number (or a surrogate of
cell number) after treatment

3. cell_count__time0 - column with initial (Time 0) cell counts - the
measure of cell number in untreated wells grown in parallel until the
time of treatment

4. cell_count__ctrl - column with the Control cell count: the measure of
cell number in control (e.g. untreated or DMSO-treated) wells from the
same plate

All other columns will be treated as additional keys on which the data
will be grouped (e.g. cell_line, drug, time, replicate)

The mandatory columns for inputData for Case "C" are the following as
well as other grouping columns.

1. concentration - column with concentration values (not log transformed)
of the perturbagen on which dose-response curves will be evaluated

2. cell_count - column with the measure of cell number (or a surrogate of
cell number)

3. time - column with the time at which a cell count is observed

All other columns will be treated as additional keys on which the data
will be grouped (e.g. cell_line, drug, replicate)

GR values and dose-response curves/metrics can also be computed using
division times for (untreated) cell lines in the place of time zero cell
counts, using the first formula in the Supplement of Hafner et al. (2017,
\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3882}).

To use division rate instead of initial cell count,
inputData should not have any initial cell counts (i.e. For Case "A", no 
"cell_count__time0" column. For Case "C", no values of 0 in the "time" 
column) and should instead have two columns "treatment_duration" and 
"division_time".

In the first column, "treatment duration", one should have the duration of 
the assay between time of treatment and the final cell counts (e.g. 72 for 
hours in a typical 3-day assay). In the second column, "division_time", one 
should have the time it takes for one cell doubling to occur in each
(untreated) cell line used under the conditions of the experiment. These 
two columns must contain numbers (no units), but need to refer to the same
units (e.g. hours). In most cases, all experiments of a particular cell 
line would have the same "division_time", however if the division rate of 
untreated cells varied on another parameter, for example seeding density,
it would be appropriate to measure and input division times based on 
cell line/seeding density pairs.
