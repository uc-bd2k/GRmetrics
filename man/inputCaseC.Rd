\title{Simulated dose-response assay data (Case C)}
\format{
A data frame with 1352 rows and 7 variables:
\itemize{
  \item cell_line: the cell-line used (MCF10A, MCF7, BT20)
  \item treatment: the drug used (-, drugA, drugB, drugC, drugD)
  \item replicate: replicate number, (1, 2, 3)
  \item time: time of assay measured in hours (0, 48, 72)
  \item concentration: concentration of the perturbagen on which
  dose-response curves will be evaluated (not log transformed)
  \item cell_count: measure of cell number or a surrogate of the number
  of cells.

\value{
An example dataset in the form of "Case C" generated for use with
\code{\link{GRfit}}
}
\description{
This is an example dataset corresponding to Case C.
The dataset is equivalent to that of Case A, but in a different form.
The data was generated by the python script "generate_data.py" found in
the "inst/scripts/" directory.
This object is meant to be used as the "inputData" argument for
the \code{\link{GRfit}} function when "case" is equal to "C".
The input data for "Case C" of the \code{\link{GRfit}} function must be in
this format with columns named "concentration", "cell_count",
and "time" as well as columns for other key
variables. The columns "cell_line", "treatment", and
"replicate", are simply examples of these key variables. It is not necessary
that your input data frame include these exact column names or the same
number of columns.
